/*
ScalaTest facilitates different styles of testing by providing traits you can mix
together to get the behavior and syntax you prefer.  A few examples are
included here.  For more information, visit:

http://www.scalatest.org/

One way to use ScalaTest is to help make JUnit or TestNG tests more
clear and concise. Here's an example:
*/

import collection.mutable.Stack
import org.scalatest._
import flatspec._
import matchers._

class AppTest extends AnyFlatSpec with should.Matchers {

  "A Stack" should "pop values in last-in-first-out order" in {
    val stack = new Stack[Int]
    stack.push(1)
    stack.push(2)
    stack.pop() should be (2)
    stack.pop() should be (1)
  }

  it should "throw NoSuchElementException if an empty stack is popped" in {
    val emptyStack = new Stack[Int]
    a [NoSuchElementException] should be thrownBy {
      emptyStack.pop()
    }
  }
}
